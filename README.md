# Neural-network
A neural network implementation on pure c++

This is an implementation of a simple neural network, which classifies english letters on images (one image - one letter). 
It's pretty simple, so it is not convolutional - it is just classical multilayer NN with backprop implemented.

The idea was to study machine learning by implementing every function which such NN needs.

Just this app gets 87% accuracy on letter classification.
Python scripts are needed to generate data, folder NN_ML is the source code folder.
